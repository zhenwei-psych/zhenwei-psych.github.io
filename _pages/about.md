About me
======
I am a second year Ph.D. student in Neuroscience at The University of Texas at Austin. I am honored to be supervised by Professor [Franco Pestilli](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/fp4834). I am interested in visual perception, visual neuroscience, and computational modeling. My research focuses on how to build computational models to best capture human visual perception.

Previously, I completed my M.A. in Psychology at New York University, where I was a member of [Landy Lab](http://wp.nyu.edu/landylab) advised by Professor [Michael Landy](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/michael-s-landy.html) and co-advised by Professor [Wei Ji Ma](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/weiji-ma.html). My research project focuses on Bayesian causal inference of audiovisual localization. Prior to that, I graduated with a B.S. in Psychology from Jilin University in northeastern China, where I completed my graduation thesis on perceptual grouping in visual crowding.
