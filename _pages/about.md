About me
======
I am a recent graduate in Master of Neuroscience from The University of Texas at Austin. I am honored to be supervised by Professor [Wilson Geisler](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/wsg8) and Professor [Eyal Seidemann](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/es58) for my master's graduation thesis. Duting my master at UT Austin, I studied computational models of primate visual perception, specifically on figure-ground perception and edge detection. We used visual psychophysics and optical imaging to investigate the neural mechanisms in V1 in macaque monkeys. 

Previously, I completed my M.A. in Psychology from New York University, where I was a member of [Landy Lab](http://wp.nyu.edu/landylab) advised by Professor [Michael Landy](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/michael-s-landy.html) and co-advised by Professor [Wei Ji Ma](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/weiji-ma.html). My research project focuses on Bayesian causal inference of audiovisual localization. Prior to that, I graduated with a B.S. in Psychology from Jilin University in northeastern China, where I completed my graduation thesis on perceptual grouping in visual crowding.
