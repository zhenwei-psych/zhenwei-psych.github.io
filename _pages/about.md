I am a first-year PhD student in Neuroscience at University of Texas at Austin. I am honored to be supervised by Professor [](). I am interested in visual perception, visual neuroscience, and computational modeling. My research focuses on how to build computational models to best capture human perception.

Previously, I completed my M.A. in Psychology at New York University, where I was a member of [Landy Lab](http://wp.nyu.edu/landylab) advised by Professor [Michael S Landy](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/michael-s-landy.html) and co-advised by Professor [Wei Ji Ma](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/weiji-ma.html). My research project focuses on Bayesian causal inference of audiovisual localization.

I graduated with a B.S. in psychology from Jilin University, where I completed my graduation thesis in visual crowding with Prof. Bing Li.
